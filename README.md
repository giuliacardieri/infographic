# Agility at Swisscom
An interactive infographic about Agility at Swisscom, developed as a pilot project for Cleverclip's Front-end developer/Interactive design position.

# Illustrations
All illustrations were created using SVG and animated using CSS.

# Developing process
Initially prototypes were made on Sketch, in order to define how the infographic would work, the typography and colors.
Pink/red and blue were chosen because of Swisscom visual identity.
After the prototypes were chosen, a prototype using HTML, CSS (scss) and jQuery was made. When the prototype was done I started working on the illustrations.
After each illustration was done, the svg file was compressed and optimized using [Jake Archibald SVG optimizer](https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/).
I included all SVG as code, in order to save loading time and interact better with CSS.
The CSS was organized using BEM approach.

Be aware this is a Pilot project and it's not an official product of Swisscom.
